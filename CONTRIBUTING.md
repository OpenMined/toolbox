## Analytics

We use PostHog for anonymous CLI analytics (commands, errors, usage patterns).

### Developer Setup

Exclude yourself from analytics during development:
```bash
export TOOLBOX_TEST_USER="true"
```

Add this to your .zshrc or .bashrc to exclude yourself permanently.

### Dashboard Access

Contact developers to get invited to the PostHog workspace for viewing metrics and error tracking.
