FlexOlmo allows data owners to contribute to the development of language models *without giving up control of their data*. There’s no need to share raw data directly, and contributors can decide when their data is active in the model. \n",

This allows data owners to contribute asynchronously without sharing their data *while providing strong guarantees for data opt-out*. In our experiments, FlexOlmo often *matches or exceeds* the performance of specialized experts on their respective tasks. Notably, it even achieves performance very close to an upper-bound reference model trained on all combined public and closed datasets.  Data owners who want to benefit from AI, but are hesitant to share their raw data or hand over control of it to a third party, can now participate *without compromising the things they value*. \n",
